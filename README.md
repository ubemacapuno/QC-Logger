## QC Logger
Please be advised that the <a target="_blank" href="https://qc-buddy.netlify.app/">DEMO</a> may become disconnected from the API during feature updates!


Record your QC laboratory results using QC Logger! This app was inspired by my prior experience as a laboratory professional, where I would routinely record QC test results on paper. Why not make it electronic?! This full-stack project is made with React and Supabase.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

React, Supabase, JavaScript/HTML/CSS

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start Application
$ npm start
```

## Things to add:
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
  - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=[Enter Supabase URL Here]
  - REACT_APP_ANON_KEY=[Enter Supabase Key Here]

## Lessons Learned:
Better knowledge of React hooks, such as useEffect and useState. Better knowledge of using Supabase API calls to connect to the Supabase backend.

## Optimizations:
I would like to eventually build out authentication, RLS, and an audit trail feature.
